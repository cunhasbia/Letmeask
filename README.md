## The project

**Letmeask is a fully interactive live Q&A platform**, perfect for streamers/content creators and their audience.

By accessing the application as a room creator, you can receive questions in real time, highlight a question, mark as answered or delete any question and close the room whenever you want.

On the user's side it is possible to enter an existing room, send questions in real time and also able to like other questions.

This is a project developed during the [NLW#6 Together](https://nextlevelweek.com), from June 20th to 27th, 2021.
